# Legos

A full-stack web application created with ejs, tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, Bycrypt, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize.

I created this app as my assignment/project for semester 3 of the Bachelor of Software Development program at Seneca.
It's a basic CRUD(Create Read Update Delete) app with user sign-in, Login, and user history.
